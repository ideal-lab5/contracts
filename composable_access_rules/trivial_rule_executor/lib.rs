//! 
//! Rule Executor Contract
//! 
//! # Goal
//! This contract allows data consumers to unlock data for which
//! composable access rules have been specified. It accomplishes this by retrieving any composable access rules 
//! associated with a given data asset class and executing each one. Post execution, the contract submits a call
//! to request bytes from the network (which is then processed by a proxy node)
//! 
//! ## Functions
//! 
//! ### execute
//! 
//! Execute each composable access rule. In this case, we only execute the single use rule.
//! After execution, report results on chain
//! 
//!
