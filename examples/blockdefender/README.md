# Block Defender

Block defender is a proof of concept to demonstrate how to develop p2p games on the etf network.

Block defender leverages *three*  distinct 'game event clocks' to drive the game. The clocks feed into each other and attempt to create a semi-sustainable feedback loop.

The game starts with a finite [MxN] grid.

There are three phases:

1. Mine
2. Build
3. Attack
